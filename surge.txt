 navbar: the app is currently having two main pages:
    1. default route: displays person's profile.
    2. daily-bites: displays the notes of the person.

We want to provide in page navigation for profile sections such as about, skill, contact, etc.
And currently all these in page navigation links are also part of main nav-bar.
We can think the following way:
1. let it remain like this.
2. nav-bar should provide main page level links only: 1. home/profile and 2. daily-bites.
    And then for each page, we can consider providing an in page navigation bar.

======================== app layout ====================
>> Two pages profile and daily-bites are represented by profile component and daily-bite-page component respectively.
>> These components are put inside router-outlet inside app component.
